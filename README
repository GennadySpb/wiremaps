Wiremaps
========

Wiremaps is an application to gather wiring information on a network
using protocols like LLDP, EDP, CDP and SONMP. It also gathers
information from the FDB (MAC-port table on switches), the ARP table
(MAC-IP table) and some miscellaneous information like interface names.

Installation
------------

To use this application, you need the following Debian packages:
 - postgresql-8.2 (PostgreSQL 8.2 - http://www.postgresql.org)
 - python-pgsql (PyPgSQL Python bindings - http://pypgsql.sourceforge.net/)
 - python-twisted-core (Twisted - http://twistedmatrix.com)
 - python-twisted-names (Twisted Names - http://twistedmatrix.com)
 - python-nevow (Nevow - http://divmod.org/trac/wiki/DivmodNevow)
 - python-ipy (iPy - http://c0re.23.nu/c0de/IPy/)
 - python-pynetsnmp (PyNetSNMP from ZenOSS project)
 - python-yaml (PyYAML - http://pyyaml.org/)

For PyNetSNMP, the tarball is here:
 http://dev.zenoss.org/svn/trunk/inst/externallibs/

On other distributions, you should find the proper package or download
and install from the website.

You then need to create a database and install the corresponding
schema. As postgres user ("su - postgres"), you can use the following:

  createuser -P wiremaps
  createdb -O wiremaps wiremaps

Then load the content of doc/database.sql:

  psql -h localhost -U wiremaps -W < doc/database.sql

You need to write a "wiremaps.cfg" file. See doc/wiremaps.cfg.sample
for an example. This file should be located in the same directory as
wiremaps.tac or in /etc/wiremaps/wiremaps.cfg.

The logo need to be located in wiremaps/wiremaps/web/static directory.

You can launch the application by hand:
 twistd -noy wiremaps.tac

There is no need to launch it as root! To launch it as a daemon:
 twistd -oy wiremaps.tac

You can also use doc/init.d as a base for an init script.
