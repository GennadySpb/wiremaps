Important changes in Wiremaps
=============================

 - Wiremaps features a time travel function which needs a new database
   schema. Since upgrading existing schema was considered too
   difficult, you need to reinstall the database from scratch. On
   startup, Wiremaps will tell you how to do that.

 - It is now possible to go back in time. A clock icon has appeared at
   the top of the interface and allows to input a date in the
   past. Validation is done with `Enter' key. The background will
   change to indicate that now every request is done in the past. To
   go back in the present, just click the clock again.
